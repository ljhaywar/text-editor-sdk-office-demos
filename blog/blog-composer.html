                  I went to the Steamtown Mall with Ryan yesterday, and I saw the cutest dress on a manequinn, and I knew I had to have it. It was a black sequined mini dress with a scoop neck top. Very classy. <br><br>
        
                  A little black dress will never go out of style, so I begged Ryan to buy it for me. He refused, which made me really mad. I gave him the silent treatment, but I think he liked that. When I realized it wasn't working, I finally said, “Fine!” and I bought it myself. <br><br>
                  
                  Whenever I get a new dress, I HAVE to buy new shoes. How ridiculous would it look to be wearing this year's dress with last year's shoes? Super ridiculous! <br><br>
                  
                  So then I dragged Ryan to each of the department stores in search of the perfect pair of shoes. And we found them! It's a pair of silver stilletos that sparkle like a mirror ball. <br><br>
                  
                  I am going to look so hot in this outfit. <br><br>
                  
                  In summary, black sequined mini dresses with silver sparkly stilletos are so on trend in 2023. Let me know what you think in the comments.
